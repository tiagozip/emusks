* [zedeus](https://github.com/zedeus) for publishing their reverse-engineered Twitter login flow for [nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter)

* [lami](https://lami.zip/) for [documenting Twitter's `x-client-transaction-id` header](https://github.com/Lqm1/x-client-transaction-id)

* part of emusks' helpers are written by LLMs due to the sheer amount of queries, most of which don't have documented parameters. The rest of the codebase is written by humans.
